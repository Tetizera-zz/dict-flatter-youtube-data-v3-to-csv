# dict-flatter-youtube-data-v3-to-csv
This code uses the Youtube Data v3 API to fetch ALL videos uploaded by a Youtube channel and creates a CSV with all the metadata available, like thumbnails, when it was uploaded, title, etc.
It might be useful to upload the metadata to Wikidata, by first getting the .csv file and then using openRefine, another free software tool, to upload new data to Wikidata.
