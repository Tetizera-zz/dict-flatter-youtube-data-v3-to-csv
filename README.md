# dict-flatter-youtube-data-v3-to-csv
This code uses the Youtube Data v3 API to fetch ALL videos uploaded by a Youtube channel and creates a .csv file with all the metadata available, like thumbnails, when it was uploaded, title, etc.

This script may be useful to upload metadata from a Youtube channel. After obtaining the .csv file, it is recommended that you use [openRefine](https://openrefine.org/), another free software tool, to upload the metadata to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org).
